## The Realm of Eldoria: A Medieval Fantasy World

### 1. Geography & Regions

* **The Ironwood Forest**: Vast, ancient woodland to the north, home to the reclusive Sylvan Elves. Massive oaks and pines dominate, with hidden glades and ruins of a long-lost elven kingdom. Wild beasts and fey creatures roam within.
* **Stormcrag Mountains**: Jagged peaks bordering the northwest, perpetually storm-lashed. Dwarven holds are carved into the mountainsides, renowned for master blacksmiths and storied forges.
* **Kingdom of Valescourt**: The central human realm, fertile plains and rolling hills. Capital city **Valecross** sits astride the River Alden. Ruled by the House of Artingale, famed for chivalry and grand tournaments.
* **Shattered Isles**: A scattered archipelago to the west, plagued by restless sea spirits. Pirate havens and sunken temples dot the isles; trade ships navigate treacherous reefs.
* **The Ember Wastes**: Arid southern desert, where nomadic clans travel between oases. Ancient ruins of a fire-worshipping empire lie buried beneath the sands.
* **Twilight Marshes**: Mist-shrouded swamplands in the east. Home to hidden covens of witches and marsh-dwelling tribes. Poisonous flora and deadly predators abound.
